```lrc
[00:00.10] 重なってた胸の音
[00:02.58] 揺さぶっても聴こえない
[00:04.89] こぼれ落ちたピース
[00:09.39] 
[00:24.99] こんな日常の憂鬱さえ
[00:29.40] ため息も出ずに無感情な僕ら
[00:35.90] 
[00:35.03] Life filled with vanity
[00:37.58] Colors have faded
[00:38.87] Things you desire exist here
[00:42.97] Flee from this colorless world
[00:57.97] 
[00:44.32] つぎはぎの心は不安定
[00:49.94] 洗い流された初期衝動を 呼び覚まして走り出せ
[00:56.13] 拙い言葉 思うままに繋ぐよ あの日の鼓動
[01:06.88] 忘れないで
[01:09.38] 
[01:07.82] Oh my lord, it's gone!!
[01:09.15] What shall I do?
[01:10.59] Pieces I had have fell apart
[01:12.74] Where do you belong?
[01:14.39] Where should I aim?
[01:15.46] Once you've lost sight it's left to fall apart
[01:38.46] 
[01:31.67] Let's start it over again
[01:35.11] Rebuild and combine all the pieces we have lost
[01:37.98] To become one
[01:39.28] Like a puzzle
[01:40.49] Take it one at a time
[01:50.99] 
[01:52.52] When I stopped (a) rusted chain has tangled me up
[01:55.51] Tying my body onto the ground
[01:57.63] As I sink underground I call your name
[02:00.40] What can I do to see the day light once more?
[02:22.90] 
[02:03.06] Tear it apart and rip it off
[02:04.32] Break the chain now
[02:04.93] Sink down or swim up
[02:06.76] Fight your way through
[02:08.11] Seek your way out
[02:08.91] If you can not, you are left to drown deep inside
[02:10.64] Chain tangled me harder, chocking my neck
[02:31.14] 
[02:23.71] 強がってた僕のこと
[02:26.25] 見守ってた君は言う
[02:28.93] 今ここにいるよ
[02:32.43] 
[02:35.47] いつまでも消えない思いを
[02:41.31] つなぎ止められた初期衝動を
[02:43.84] 呼び覚まして走り出せ
[02:47.32] あの日の鼓動は
[02:51.44] 僕と君の中の宇宙で響いているよ
[02:58.94] 
[03:06.51] Aaah!
[03:09.44] Misery is nothing
[03:11.88] It is all up to your thoughts and beliefs to bring in success
[03:15.00] Within your life
[03:23.00] 
[03:16.69] Don't you compare yourself with other people
[03:19.18] That's a waste of person you are so why not be honest to your emotion
[03:25.56] 忘れないで
[03:28.06] 
[03:26.75] All the promises made between us
[03:29.39] Broke in pieces (and) turned into sand
[03:31.55] Let's escape from this colorless world to find myself
[03:35.52] And tomorrow we live
